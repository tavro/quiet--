perfection is like a freshly washed window
but not the window itself
it is the light falling through
it is a cup of coffee that never cools
a pen that writes without hesitation
as if it knows exactly what it wants to say
and always knew it

perfection is not a straight line
it is the bend where the road bends
where the world for a moment feels unexpectedly soft
perfection is to be there
right there
with everything that cannot be put into words

perfection is when she ties her shoes
not to go anywhere in particular
not to show off to the world
the world just happens to be there
ready to be dyed in her beauty
