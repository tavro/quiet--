one day you wake up thinking about the bible
not about god, or jesus, or moses
but about the book itself
the thick, black book
that sits on your grandmother's bookshelf
next to old cookbooks and photo albums
filled with people you have never met
sometimes you pick it up
let your fingers sweep across the pages
as if the pages might start to glow
if only you touched them the right way
the bible isn't just a book, you think
you try to read a few lines
old-fashioned phrases
you read without really reading
you close the book and stare at the cover
the cross, the gold nearly flaked away
the muted scent of old dust
why does it feel so important?
even though you do not believe
why can't you just leave it there?
like any other book
you put it back
tell yourself you will read it one day
but not today
and probably not tomorrow either
you brush a layer of dust from the shelf's edge
and move on with your life
