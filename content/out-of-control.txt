i dreamt of you before i knew what your face looked like--
no dream would be a dream if it could pass for something real
i did not get a chance to say hi
you were gone before we got that far
all i know is now i really need you
yet when i look for you, you are not there
i cannot think i will not see you again
i wish you saw my thoughts right through my eyes
i have waited long across lifetimes for your face
we parted so painfully
we must see each other again
and please smile for me again
how can i know so surely that we will meet again
when i do not even know how to speak to you
