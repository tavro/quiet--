i bought these pants because they were half price
they were corduroy
brown
wrinkled in a way that shows i have lived a little
i found a folded slip of paper
tucked into the left front pocket
it was a poem
written in blue pen
on lined paper torn from a notebook
there were no rhymes
i sat on the floor
reading someone else’s breakdown
i read it twice
then a third time
like a creep
i do not know who wrote it
but i folded the poem back up
exactly how i found it
and now
every time i wear these pants
i like to think
they left it there on purpose..
so if you ever see me
standing still
in corduroy pants
for longer than is socially acceptable
do not worry
i am just reading the poem again
